The Synarmosma library consists of approximately 20,000 lines of C++ code and has been developed 
and tested in a Linux (x86, x86-64 and ARMv6) environment. The library's external dependencies 
consist of the Boost library (www.boost.org), Victor Shoup's number-theoretic library NTL (www.shoup.net/ntl),
the Gnu multiprecision library (www.gmplib.org) and an implementation of LAPACK for certain dense 
matrix operations. The Synarmosma library is released under the Gnu Public License version 3.0 
(see LICENSE.txt or www.fsf.org/licensing for details).   

To install the Synarmosma library, enter the directory <code>synarmosma</code>, where the command <code>make</code> will carry 
out the build process and <code>make test</code> to carry out some basic tests of certain classes and methods 
of the Synarmosma library. The command <code>sudo make install</code> will install the library in its default 
location, /usr/local/synarmosma. If you don't have root access or don't wish to install the library 
in a system directory, you can modify the value of <code>INSTALL_DIR</code> at the beginning of the Makefile to 
some other directory, such as <code>$HOME/synarmosma</code>. The compilation of the Synarmosma library has been 
tested using both the Gnu (g++) and Intel (icpc) compilers in a Linux environment. In principle it should also 
run under Windows using the Cygwin environment. Finally you can use <code>make clean</code> to delete all the 
object files.   

Normally the only parameters that a user should need to modify in order to build the Synarmosma library 
are located at the beginning of the Makefile, where various compiler arguments and libraries are all 
specified. The build variables are all described in the Makefile and in general the default values should 
be safe on most Unix-like platforms. Certain methods within the library have been parallelized using 
OpenMP, namely for the Geometry, Graph, Nexus and Matrix classes, so that a C++ compiler able to support 
OpenMP is also desirable.
